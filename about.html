                Syphos is a writing tool that helps you focus on writing by providing a distraction-free environment. It
                is designed to make ideas flow efficiently and improve productivity without the worry for editing and
                refinement. Treat this environment as a blank canvas to paint all your unfiltered thoughts and ideas, an
                endless stream for you to carry out your creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name is derived from Sisyphus, a figure in Greek mythology who was condemned to roll a boulder up a
                hill only for it to roll back down each time he reached the top. This is a metaphor for the struggle of
                writing, where you may feel like you're constantly pushing a boulder uphill, only to have it roll back
                down again. But just like Sisyphus, you can find meaning and purpose in the struggle of writing. Syphos
                is here to help you embrace that struggle and turn it into something beautiful.

            <p>Syphos is a writing tool that helps you focus on writing by providing a distraction-free environment. It
                is designed to make ideas flow efficiently and improve productivity without the worry for editing and
                refinement. Treat this environment as a blank canvas to paint all your unfiltered thoughts and ideas, an
                endless stream for you to carry out your creativity.

                Begin by setting a word count or a time limit goal. The idle time is the amount of time you can spend
                not writing before the timer resets and everything gets erased. Harsh, but the best ideas come with a
                little bit of pressure. If you need to take a break, you can pause the timer and resume when you're
                ready. When you reach the goal, the writing session ends and you can save your work. Take your time to
                explore other accessibility features in the tool bar to make the space yours. There's also a AI writing
                prompt generator on the bottom left.
